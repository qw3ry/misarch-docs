# [ADR-4] No category hierarchy

:::warning
Is this ADR feasible? It sounds very "this is for scientific purposes, so it's good enough".
:::

## Context and Problem Statement

A category hierarchy would enable better navigation of categories in the frontend.

## Considered Options

- Category hierarchy
- No Category hierarchy

## Decision Outcome

No Category hierarchy, simpler and good enough.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Category hierarchy

- Good, extensive filter options
- Neutral, hierarchy tree needs to be kept consistent
- Bad, removing a category gets more complicated
- Good, higher flexibility of assigning categories. Unsuitable super-categories can be avoided

### No Category hierarchy

- Good, simpler as each category is independent of each other
- Good, hierarchy layer could be added dynamically if required:
- Bad, user might lose track of the category context: For example: A category bow might represent weapons or tools for the violin
